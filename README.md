# pyRiemann-qiskit

Litterature on quantum computing suggests it may offer an advantage as compared with
classical computing in terms of computational time and outcomes, such as for pattern
recognition or when using limited training sets [1, 2].

A ubiquitous library on quantum computing is Qiskit [3]. Qiskit is an IBM library
distributed under Apache 2.0 which provides both quantum algorithms and backends. A
backend can be either your local machine or a remote machine, which one can emulates or be
a quantum machine. Qiskit abstraction over the type of machine you want to use, make
designing quantum algorithm seamless.

Qiskit implements a quantum version of support vector -like classifiers, known as
quantum-enhanced support vector classifier (QSVC) and varitional quantum classifier (VQC)
[4]. These classifiers likely offer an advantage over classical SVM in situations where
the classification task is complex. Task complexity is raised by the encoding of the data
into a quantum state, the number of available data and the quality of the data. An initial
study is available in [5], and it can be downloaded from
[here](doc/Presentations/QuantumERPClassification.pdf). Although there is no study on this
topic at the time of writting, this could be an interesting research direction to
investigate BCI illiteracy.

pyRiemann-qiskit implements a wrapper around QSVC and VQC, to use quantum classification
with Riemannian geometry. A use case would be to use vectorized covariance matrices in the
tangent space as an input for these classifiers, enabling a possible sandbox for
researchers and engineers in the field.

The remaining details some of the quantum drawbacks and will guide you through
installation. Full documentation, including API description, is available at
<https://pyriemann-qiskit.readthedocs.io/>. The repository also includes a
[wiki](https://github.com/pyRiemann/pyRiemann-qiskit/wiki) where you can find additional
information.

## Quantum drawbacks

- Limitation of the feature dimension

  The number of qubits (and therefore the feature dimension) is limited to:

  - 24 on a local quantum simulator, and up to:
  - 5000 on a remote quantum simulator;
  - 5 on free real quantum computers, and up to:
  - 65 on exploratory quantum computers (not available for public use).

- Time complexity

  A higher number of trials or dimension increases time to completion of the quantum
  algorithm, especially when running on a local machine. This is why the number of trials
  is limited in the examples we provided. However, you should avoid such practices in your
  own analysis.

  Although these aspects are less important in a remote backend, it may happen that the
  quantum algorithm is queued depending on the number of concurrent users.

  For all these aspects, the use of pyRiemann-qiskit should be limited to offline analysis
  only.

## Installation

_We recommend the use of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to manage python
environements._

`pyRiemann-qiskit` currently supports Windows, Mac and Linux OS with Python 3.7, 3.8 and
3.9.

You can install `pyRiemann-qiskit` release from PyPI:

```
pip install pyriemann-qiskit
```

The development version can be installed by cloning this repository and installing the
package on your local machine using the `setup.py` script:

```
python setup.py develop
```

To check the installation, open a python shell and type:

```
import pyriemann_qiskit
```

To enable Qiskit GPU optimization when using quantum simulation, run:

```
pip install .[optim]
```

Note, Qiskit only provide binaries for Linux. For other platforms, or if you want to
enable specific NVIDIA optimization for quantum, you need to build the binary
[yourself](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-with-gpu-support).

To run a specific example on your local machine, you should install first dependencies for
the documentation:

```
pip install .[docs]
```

Then you can run the python example of your choice like:

```
python examples\ERP\classify_P300_bi.py
```

### Installation with docker

We also offer the possibility to set up the dev environment within docker. To this end, we
recommand to use `vscode` with the `Remote Containers` extension from Microsoft.

Once the installation is successful, just open the project in `vscode` and enter `F1`. In
the search bar that opens, type `Rebuild and Reopen Container`.

Wait for the container to build, and open a python shell within the container. Then ensure
everything went smoothly by typing:

```
import pyriemann_qiskit
```

Alternatively you can from the console (Windows or Linux) build the docker image from our
Dockerfile. Go to the root folder of pyRiemann-qiskit and type:

```
docker build -t pyrq .
```

Next use `docker run --detach pyrq` to enter the pyRiemann-qiskit image.

If you wish, you can also download docker images directly from github docker registry:
https://github.com/pyRiemann/pyRiemann-qiskit/pkgs/container/pyriemann-qiskit

They are pushed to the docker registry on each release.

## Contributor Guidelines

Everyone is welcomed to contribute to this repository. There are two types of
contributions:

- [Raise an issue](https://github.com/pyRiemann/pyRiemann-qiskit/issues/new) on the
  repository. Issues can be either a bug report or an enhancement proposal. Note that it
  is necessary to register on GitHub before. There is no special template which is
  expected but, if you raise a defect please provide as much details as possible.

- [Raise a pull request](https://github.com/pyRiemann/pyRiemann-qiskit/compare). Fork the
  repository and work on your own branch. Then raise a pull request with your branch
  against master. As much as possible, we ask you to:
  - avoid merging master into your branch. Always prefer git rebase.
  - always provide full documentation of public method.

Code contribution (pull request) can be either on core functionalities, documentation or
automation.

- The core functionalies are based on `Python`,
  [pyRiemann](https://github.com/pyRiemann/pyRiemann),
  [Qiskit ML](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-machine-learning) and follow the best
  practice from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). We use
  `flake8` for code formatting. `flake8` is installed with the testing dependencies (see
  below) or can be installed directly from `pip`:

  ```
  pip install flake8
  ```

  To execute `flake8`, just type `flake8` from the root repository, and correct all errors
  related to your changes.

- The documentation is based on [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
- Automation is based on `GitHub Action` and `pytest`. It consists in two automated
  workflows for running the example and the tests. To run the tests on your local machine,
  you should first install the dependencies for testing:

  ```
  pip install .[tests]
  ```

  and then type `pytest` from the root repository. You can also specify a file like:

  ```
  pytest tests/test_classification.py
  ```

  Workflows are automatically triggered when you push a commit. However, the worflow for
  example execution is only triggered when you modify one of the examples or the
  documentation as the execution take a lot of time. You can enable
  [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository)
  in your fork to see the result of the CI pipeline. Results are also indicated at the end
  of your pull request when raised. However note, that workflows in the pull request need
  approval from the maintainers before being executed.

# Troubleshooting

## Version of pyRiemann not updated

There is a known issue when you install `pyRiemann-qiskit` in an environement where there
is already `pyRiemann` installed. In such case, the `pyRiemann` version is not updated.
Therefore before installing or updating `pyRiemann-qiskit`, we recommend to install
`pyRiemann` as it follows:

```
pip uninstall pyriemann
pip install pyriemann@git+https://github.com/pyRiemann/pyRiemann#egg=pyriemann
```

## Firebase admin not loading

In some environment, the firebase admin module is not loaded. There is two reasons:

1. The protobuf package is missing an `__init__.py` file. You can fix this issue by adding
   it manually as it is done in the DockerFile:

```
touch /usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/protobuf-4.22.1-py3.8-linux-x86_64.egg/google/__init__.py
```

2. The Firestore service contains unused dependency to `google.cloud.location`. You can
   fix this issue by removing the dependencies manually, as it is done in the DockerFile
   too:

```
sed -i 's/from google.cloud.location import locations_pb2//g' '/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/google_cloud_firestore-2.10.1-py3.8.egg/google/cloud/firestore_v1/services/firestore/client.py'
sed -i 's/from google.cloud.location import locations_pb2//g' '/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/google_cloud_firestore-2.10.1-py3.8.egg/google/cloud/firestore_v1/services/firestore/transports/base.py'
sed -i 's/from google.cloud.location import locations_pb2//g' '/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/google_cloud_firestore-2.10.1-py3.8.egg/google/cloud/firestore_v1/services/firestore/transports/grpc.py'
sed -i 's/from google.cloud.location import locations_pb2//g' '/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/google_cloud_firestore-2.10.1-py3.8.egg/google/cloud/firestore_v1/services/firestore/transports/grpc_asyncio.py'
sed -i 's/from google.cloud.location import locations_pb2//g' '/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/google_cloud_firestore-2.10.1-py3.8.egg/google/cloud/firestore_v1/services/firestore/transports/rest.py'
sed -i 's/from google.cloud.location import locations_pb2//g' '/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/google_cloud_firestore-2.10.1-py3.8.egg/google/cloud/firestore_v1/services/firestore/async_client.py'
```
