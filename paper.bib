	abstract = {This paper presents a new classification framework for brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery. This framework involves the concept of Riemannian geometry in the manifold of covariance matrices. The main idea is to use spatial covariance matrices as EEG signal descriptors and to rely on Riemannian geometry to directly classify these matrices using the topology of the manifold of symmetric and positive definite (SPD) matrices. This framework allows to extract the spatial information contained in EEG signals without using spatial filtering. Two methods are proposed and compared with a reference method [multiclass Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)] on the multiclass dataset IIa from the BCI Competition IV. The first method, named minimum distance to Riemannian mean (MDRM), is an implementation of the minimum distance to mean (MDM) classification algorithm using Riemannian distance and Riemannian mean. This simple method shows comparable results with the reference method. The second method, named tangent space LDA (TSLDA), maps the covariance matrices onto the Riemannian tangent space where matrices can be vectorized and treated as Euclidean objects. Then, a variable selection procedure is applied in order to decrease dimensionality and a classification by LDA is performed. This latter method outperforms the reference method increasing the mean classification accuracy from 65.1\% to 70.2\%.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the estimation of spatio-temporal patterns in the context of event-related potentials or evoked potentials studies in neuroscience is addressed. The proposed framework (denoted xDAWN) has the advantage to require only the knowledge of the time of stimuli onsets which are determined by the experimental setup. A theoretical analysis of the xDAWN framework shows that it provides asymptotically optimal spatial filters under weak assumptions. The loss in signal to interference-plus-noise ratio due to finite sample effect is calculated in a closed form at the first order of perturbation and is then validated by simulations. This last result shows that the proposed method provides interesting performance and outperforms classical methods, such as independent component analysis, in a wide range of situations. Moreover, the xDAWN algorithm has the property to be robust with respect to the model parameter values. Finally, validations on real electro-encephalographic data confirm the good behavior of the proposed xDAWN framework in the context of a P300 speller brain-computer interface.},

By combining quantum computing methods with classical neural network techniques we aim to foster an increase of performance in solving classification problems. Our algorithm is designed for existing and near-term quantum devices. We propose a novel hybrid variational quantum classifier that combines the quantum gradient descent method with steepest gradient descent to optimise the parameters of the network. By applying this algorithm to a resonance search in di-top final states, we find that this method has a better learning outcome than a classical neural network or a quantum machine learning method trained with a non-quantum optimisation method. The classifiers ability to be trained on small amounts of data indicates its benefits in data-driven classification problems.},

	abstract = {Machine learning and quantum computing are two technologies that each have the potential to alter how computation is performed to address previously untenable problems. Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous in pattern recognition, with support vector machines (SVMs) being the best known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such classification problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element in the computational speed-ups enabled by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here we propose and experimentally implement two quantum algorithms on a superconducting processor. A key component in both methods is the use of the quantum state space as feature space. The use of a quantum-enhanced feature space that is only efficiently accessible on a quantum computer provides a possible path to quantum advantage. The algorithms solve a problem of supervised learning: the construction of a classifier. One method, the quantum variational classifier, uses a variational quantum circuit1,2 to classify the data in a way similar to the method of conventional SVMs. The other method, a quantum kernel estimator, estimates the kernel function on the quantum computer and optimizes a classical SVM. The two methods provide tools for exploring the applications of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers3 to machine learning.},

	abstract = {The effectiveness of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold features has been proven in various computer vision tasks. However, due to the non-Euclidean geometry of these features, existing Euclidean machineries cannot be directly used. In this paper, we tackle the classification tasks with limited training data on SPD manifolds. Our proposed framework, named Manifold Convex Class Model, represents each class on SPD manifolds using a convex model, and classification can be performed by computing distances to the convex models. We provide three methods based on different metrics to address the optimization problem of the smallest distance of a point to the convex model on SPD manifold. The efficacy of our proposed framework is demonstrated both on synthetic data and several computer vision tasks including object recognition, texture classification, person re-identification and traffic scene classification.},

	abstract = {Quantum support vector machines employ quantum circuits to define the kernel function. It has been shown that this approach offers a provable exponential speedup compared to any known classical algorithm for certain data sets. The training of such models corresponds to solving a convex optimization problem either via its primal or dual formulation. Due to the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, the training algorithms are affected by statistical uncertainty, which has a major impact on their complexity. We show that the dual problem can be solved in \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(M{\textasciicircum}\{4.67\}/{\textbackslash}varepsilon{\textasciicircum}2)\$ quantum circuit evaluations, where \$M\$ denotes the size of the data set and \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ the solution accuracy. We prove under an empirically motivated assumption that the kernelized primal problem can alternatively be solved in \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}({\textbackslash}min {\textbackslash}\{ M{\textasciicircum}2/{\textbackslash}varepsilon{\textasciicircum}6, {\textbackslash}, 1/{\textbackslash}varepsilon{\textasciicircum}\{10\} {\textbackslash}\})\$ evaluations by employing a generalization of a known classical algorithm called Pegasos. Accompanying empirical results demonstrate these analytical complexities to be essentially tight. In addition, we investigate a variational approximation to quantum support vector machines and show that their heuristic training achieves considerably better scaling in our experiments.},

Most of these algorithms are either heuristic or assume that data can be accessed quantum-mechanically, making it unclear whether a quantum advantage can be proven without resorting to strong assumptions. Here we construct a classification problem with which we can rigorously show that heuristic quantum kernel methods can provide an end-to-end quantum speed-up with only classical access to data. To prove the quantum speed-up, we construct a family of datasets and show that no classical learner can classify the data inverse-polynomially better than random guessing, assuming the widely believed hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. Furthermore, we construct a family of parameterized unitary circuits, which can be efficiently implemented on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, and use them to map the data samples to a quantum feature space and estimate the kernel entries. The resulting quantum classifier achieves high accuracy and is robust against additive errors in the kernel entries that arise from finite sampling statistics.},

Based on real card payment data, a thorough comparison is performed to assess the complementary impact brought in by the current state-of-the-art Quantum Machine Learning algorithms with respect to the Classical Approach. A new method to search for best features is explored using the Quantum Support Vector Machine's feature map characteristics. The results are compared using fraud specific key performance indicators: Accuracy, Recall, and False Positive Rate, extracted from analyses based on human expertise (rule decisions), classical machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost) and quantum based machine learning algorithms using QSVM. In addition, a hybrid classical-quantum approach is explored by using an ensemble model that combines classical and quantum algorithms to better improve the fraud prevention decision. We found, as expected, that the results highly depend on feature selections and algorithms that are used to select them. The QSVM provides a complementary exploration of the feature space which led to an improved accuracy of the mixed quantum-classical method for fraud detection, on a drastically reduced data set to fit current state of Quantum Hardware.},
